        My educational journey has played a key role in shaping my skills as a developer.
        Studying Computer Science has given me a solid foundation in programming, data structures, algorithms, and
        software engineering principles. Beyond the classroom, I’ve applied my academic knowledge through real-world projects, online courses, and continuous self-learning.
        I believe education is a lifelong process, and I’m always eager to learn new technologies and improve my craft as a full stack developer.

  <h3>💎Specialties :</h3>
  <p>
    Throughout my academic and project journey, I’ve been recognized for my ability to collaborate effectively and lead with clarity.
    Whether working on group assignments or real-world client projects, I naturally stepped into leadership roles—organizing tasks, motivating team members, and ensuring deadlines were met.
  </p>

  <h3>🎖️Achievements :</h3>
  <p>
    During my academic journey, I’ve consistently pushed myself beyond textbooks.
    I built several full-stack projects using modern technologies like React and Node.js, earned online certifications, and maintained a strong CGPA.
    One of my proudest achievements was developing and deploying my personal portfolio website entirely on my own.
    I’ve also led team-based assignments, participated in programming contests, and continued to learn new tools
    like GitHub, Figma, and Postman—all while managing my responsibilities outside of academics.
