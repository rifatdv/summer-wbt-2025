            <p>
                Over the past few years, I have worked on a range of web development projects that showcase both my technical ability and creative problem-solving skills.
                From building responsive portfolio websites to developing full-stack applications with user authentication, real-time features, and RESTful APIs, I‚Äôve consistently focused on clean code, performance, and user experience.
                One of my proudest achievements was leading a small team to deliver a project management tool using the MERN stack, where I handled both frontend UI and backend logic.
                These experiences not only sharpened my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node.js, but also taught me valuable lessons in teamwork, project planning, and client communication.

    <p>
        Over the course of these projects, I achieved several milestones that reflect my growth as a developer. I successfully led a small development team to complete
        a full-stack project ahead of schedule, significantly improving collaboration and productivity.
        By integrating secure authentication systems using JWT and bcrypt, and optimizing frontend performance with React lazy loading,
        I improved both security and user experience. Many of my applications were fully responsive across all devices, and some achieved
        up to 40% faster load times through code optimization.
        I also designed RESTful APIs with efficient data handling and implemented real-time features using Firebase and MongoDB.
        These achievements not only strengthened my technical skills but also built my confidence in team leadership, deployment workflows, and delivering polished, client-ready solutions.
