    I‚Äôve explored both frontend and backend technologies, allowing me to create seamless user experiences and robust systems behind the scenes.
    Each project has taught me something new‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs solving real-world problems, collaborating with others, or optimizing for performance.
    Today, I‚Äôm driven by a deep curiosity to keep learning and a desire to create digital solutions that make a difference.
